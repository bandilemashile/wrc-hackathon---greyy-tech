Project Description 
water delivery truck locator website that uses tracking technology to display to community members in real time where water trucks are at a given point when a water incident happens within an area and water needs to be delivered to the community using these trucks which happens regularly in South Africa from major cities such as Tshwane to small towns in secluded areas.The website will act as a portal for water truck procurement execution meaning once a town or city has a water problem, the city officials will register all the hired trucks onto the system and we will tracka and display the trucks to community members that search their area meaning we can display for multiple places at once

Motivation 
-we often have water problems within our communities where water trucks have to be used to deliver water but the community never knows where these water trucks are most of the time and when they are available  the water trucks have to consistently go to the water depot station where they have to refill leaving members standing on the street with no insight where the water trucks are
-The water truck delivery industry still uses paper based means to log transanctions on the amounts of delivered water to the community and that is not easily backed up  and causes room for doubt especially considering that water truck delivery undergoes outsourcing to thrid party company that hae won the tender from the government so there need to be more transperency in the process

Impact 
This will make an impact on how we deal with an ongoing water crisis in a community 
lessen the problems associated with having to go and collect water from a water truck
improve service delivery and communication
offer a technological upgrade to the traditioal water delivery industry
